# ANSI C to MIPS Compiler

A compiler from ANSI-C to MIPS assembly, produced as part of the Instruction Architectures and Compilers module at Imperial College London. The module forms part of the second year of Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE).

The spec is visible [here](https://github.com/thl19git/ANSI-C-to-MIPS-Compiler/blob/master/spec.md).

This project was worked on in a pair - I was personally responsible for the parser and AST generation, in addition to lots of the assembly generation and tests.
